# PiCamCV-FSharp
A port of @neutmute 's PiCamCV project written in F#. It currently makes use of the following technologies:

1. Alchemy WebSocket Server - https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/Alchemy-Websockets
2. Emgu CV - http://www.emgu.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
3. ASP.NET
4. F#

## Project motivation

PiCamCV-FSharp was made to provide imaging via the Raspberry Pi on a Tamiya Tank chassis. It is a port of PiCamCV which is written in C#. 
I aim to control the tank via the Pi and will continue to post the source code here as the project progresses. 
You can read more on the project here: http://www.techyian.co.uk/f-emgu-cv-and-asp-net-robotics-project-part-1/

I also wanted to try to learn F#, so this is my first attempt, and I will look at improving the code as I become more familiar and comfortable with F#.

## Getting Started

Full instructions on how to build Emgu CV and get the code running on your Raspberry Pi are documented here: http://www.techyian.co.uk/f-emgu-cv-and-asp-net-robotics-project-part-2/
